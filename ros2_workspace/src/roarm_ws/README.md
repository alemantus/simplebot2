## 3 Controlling a Physical Robotic Arm with Driver Nodes
### 3.1 Connect the Robotic Arm and Identify the Serial Port
Before connecting the robotic arm via USB, check the current serial devices on your Ubuntu system:
    ls /dev/tty*

Then, connect the robotic arm. Be sure to connect to the Type-C port in the middle of the PCB board (the edge Type-C port is for radar connection and does not communicate with the ESP32). Click on `Devices → USB → select the device with "CP210x"` in its name from the Oracle VM VirtualBox menu. If prompted that the device cannot be mounted, you may need to shut down the virtual machine.

Ensure your computer (Windows) can detect this USB device.

Next, in the VM settings, locate the USB device section, check Enable USB Controller, select `USB 3.0 (xHCI)` Controller, and add a USB filter for the device with "CP210x" in its name. Click OK.

Run the VM again, and from the top menu, click Devices → USB → ensure there is a checkmark next to the device with "CP2102N USB".

Check the serial devices again:

    ls /dev/tty*

You should now see a new device like `/dev/ttyUSB0` at the end of the list. If not, disconnect and reconnect the robotic arm.

### 3.2 Running the Robotic Arm Driver Node
According to the ROS2 official documentation, it is not recommended to run ROS2 nodes in the same terminal where you compile the packages. Open a new terminal window using `Ctrl + Alt + T`.

Grant serial port permissions and run the ROS2 robotic arm driver node:

Grant read and write permissions to the serial device using the following command (replace `/dev/ttyUSB0` with your actual device path):

    sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB0

Run the driver node:

    ros2 run roarm_driver roarm_driver serial_port:=/dev/ttyUSB0

### 3.3 Viewing the Model Joints
Open a new terminal window with `Ctrl + Alt + T`.

Run Rviz2 to display the robotic arm model and the joint control panel:

Rviz2 is a visualization tool in ROS2 that can display and debug robot models, sensor data, path planning, and more. Using Rviz2, you can visually monitor the robot's movements and current position. Additionally, Rviz2 provides tools such as 3D views, timelines, and parameter adjustments to better understand the robot's behavior.

Note: When you run the following command, the robot's URDF in Rviz2 will publish the joint angles to the driver node. The driver node will convert these angles into JSON control commands for the robotic arm, causing it to move (the arm will be vertical). Ensure there are no fragile items around the robotic arm and keep children away.

    ros2 launch roarm_description display.launch.py

<video src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a93bf92d-493e-42dc-b3bd-529b0b796220" controls="controls" width="500" height="300"></video>

<video src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e818f88f-a4e7-45c9-9b53-630a1d1bb235" 
controls="controls" width="500" height="300"></video>

If you do not see the joint control panel, click the gear icon on the left to bring it to the forefront.

You can control the movement of each joint by dragging the sliders in the control panel. This is the simplest and most basic method to control the robotic arm in ROS2.

You can control the LED on the gripper of the robot arm through the following command,data is an integer, the range is [0-255].

    ros2 topic pub /led_ctrl std_msgs/msg/Float32 {"data: 0"} -1

### 3.4 Manipulating the View in Rviz2
In Rviz2, you can adjust the view of the robot model using the mouse:

Left-click and drag to move the view horizontally.
Right-click and drag to change the viewing direction and angle.
Scroll the mouse wheel to zoom in or out.
Press and hold the middle mouse button (wheel) and drag to move vertically.
These operations allow you to view the robot model from any angle and distance.


## 4 Interacting with the Robotic Arm End Effector Using MoveIt2
### 4.1 Introduction to MoveIt2
MoveIt2 is an open-source software for robotic motion planning, manipulation, and control. It provides a simple user interface to help developers handle complex motion planning problems.

MoveIt2 supports various algorithms and strategies, including motion planning, execution, monitoring, kinematics, and collision detection. Its powerful features make it widely used in industrial, research, and educational fields.

MoveIt2 operates within the ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2) environment and integrates seamlessly with other ROS2 tools and libraries, significantly improving the efficiency and convenience of robot development.

In this tutorial, we will use MoveIt2 to control the robotic arm's movements. By dragging the end effector of the robotic arm, MoveIt2 can automatically calculate the motion path and control the actual movement of the robotic arm through the driver nodes.

### 4.2 Running the MoveIt2 Demo
In the terminal window where Rviz2 is currently running, press `Ctrl + C` to close the Rviz2 session.

Run the following command to execute the robotic arm MoveIt2 demo. This demo includes inverse kinematics solving, allowing you to interact with the robotic arm by dragging the end effector:

    ros2 launch roarm_moveit roarm_moveit.launch.py 

When controlling the gripper, it should be selected as in the picture
![image](images/rviz_gripper.png)

Note: After executing this command, the robotic arm will move, with the forearm extending forward and parallel to the ground.

<video src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0ebc3ce-4761-40a7-8e54-b8d493a7fdc9"

controls="controls" width="500" height="300"></video>

If the robotic arm is not displayed in Rviz2, click on the `Fixed Frame` option in the Displays window after launching Rviz2. Beside `map`, a triangle icon will appear; click on this icon, select `world`, and press Enter to confirm.

Next, click on `Add` in the bottom left corner, then select `MotionPlanning` and click `OK`. This will display the robotic arm model. You can refer to the **3.5 Manipulating the View in Rviz2** section to change the view angle.

Now, you can change the posture of the robotic arm by dragging the sphere or XYZ axes at the end effector. This dragging will not immediately move the physical robotic arm. To execute the planned movements on the real robotic arm, you need to click the `Plan & Execute` button in the Planning tab on the right side of the screen.


## 5 Controlling the Robotic Arm with Keyboard
This chapter explains how to control the robotic arm using either keyboard keys or a gamepad. Note that the RoArm-M2-S does not come with a gamepad by default; you can purchase an Xbox Bluetooth gamepad and connect it to your computer for control.

Before running this section, you need to close the previously running MoveIt2 demo, but keep the roarm_driver node running, as it is necessary for controlling the physical robotic arm.

Enter the following command to start the nodes related to controlling the robotic arm:

    ros2 launch roarm_moveit_servo servo_control.launch.py

### 5.1 Keyboard Control
Open a new terminal and run the following command. This terminal window should remain active as it will receive control commands from the keyboard:

    ros2 run roarm_moveit_servo keyboardcontrol

Keep this terminal window active and use the following keys to control the robotic arm:

for roarm_m2:

## 7 Command Control (Invoking ROS2 Services , Actions)
In this chapter, you will learn how to control the robotic arm using command-based control by invoking ROS2 services. Close all terminal windows from the previous chapters, except for the one running roarm_driver.

Run the launch file for command control, which relies on MoveIt2 for motion planning:

    ros2 launch roarm_moveit_cmd command_control.launch.py

Note: After executing this command, the robotic arm will move, with the forearm extending forward and parallel to the horizontal plane.

If the robotic arm is not displayed in Rviz2, follow these steps:

In Rviz2, click on the Displays window.

In the Fixed Frame field, click map, which will show a triangle icon.
Click the triangle icon and select base_link, then press Enter to confirm.
Click Add in the bottom left corner, select MotionPlanning, and click OK.
You should now see the robotic arm's model. Refer to 3.5 Rviz2 View Operations to adjust the view.

You can change the robotic arm's posture by dragging the end-effector's drag ball or XYZ axis in Rviz2. However, these changes will not synchronize with the physical robotic arm until you click Plan & Execute in the Planning tab on the right.

### 7.1 Get Current Position

### 7.5 Control the gripper to the specified radian position

Publish data to a topic and use actions to control the radian position of the gripper:

    ros2 topic pub /gripper_cmd std_msgs/msg/Float32  "{data: 0.5}" -1

Here, the data is the coordinates of the target point of the gripper, in radians.
The gripper's range is 0.0~1.5.
