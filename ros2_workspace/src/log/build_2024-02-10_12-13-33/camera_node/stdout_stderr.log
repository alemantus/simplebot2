[31mCMake Error at /home/alexander/simplebot2/ros2_workspace/src/build/camera_node/_deps/grabthecam-src/CMakeLists.txt:7 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindRapidJSON.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "RapidJSON", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "RapidJSON" with
  any of the following names:

    RapidJSONConfig.cmake
    rapidjson-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "RapidJSON" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "RapidJSON_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "RapidJSON" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
